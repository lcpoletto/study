 * 1.1.24 Give the sequence of values of p and q that are computed when Euclidâ€™s algorithm
 * is used to compute the greatest common divisor of 105 and 24. Extend the code
 * given on page 4 to develop a program Euclid that takes two integers from the command
 * line and computes their greatest common divisor, printing out the two arguments for
 * each call on the recursive method. Use your program to compute the greatest common
 * divisor or 1111111 and 1234567.
